# MovieRecommendationSystem
* Archive for an old A-Level project.
* A graphical, hybrid recommendation system which incorporates both content-based and collaborative filtering methods.
  * Content-based filtering has been achieved using term-frequency analysis.
  * Collaborative filtering has been achieved through the module 'sklearn' and applying predictive methods.
* Feel free to get in touch if you experience any problems or have any questions!
