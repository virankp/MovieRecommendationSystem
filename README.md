# MovieRecommendationSystem
* Archive for an old A-Level project - run 'Movie Recommendation System.py'.
* A graphical, hybrid recommendation system which incorporates both content-based and collaborative filtering methods.
  * Content-based filtering has been achieved using term-frequency analysis.
  * Collaborative filtering has been achieved through the module 'sklearn' and applying predictive methods.
* 'Image Scraping.py' demonstrates how 'BeautifulSoup' has been used to view the rotten tomatoes website of a film and save the film posters.
* 'Database Setup.py' shows how each database table has been created.
* Feel free to get in touch if you experience any problems or have any questions!
